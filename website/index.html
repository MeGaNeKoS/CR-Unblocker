    <h2>Changelog</h2>
    <h3>4.0.0 – Major update and new proxy server</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Switched default proxy server to <b>us.community-proxy.meganeko.dev</b></li>
        <li>Now proxies only geo-restricted Crunchyroll traffic, direct for all other traffic</li>
        <li>No more session ID manipulation—unblocks anime directly</li>
        <li>Improved support for all regions, including Japan</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3.2.0 – New default proxy and improved access for restricted regions</h3>
    <p>This release changed the default proxy and improved proxy handling.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed default proxy endpoint</li>
        <li>Reduced load on proxy availability check</li>
        <li>Proxied initial website load to allow access from restricted regions like Japan</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3.1.0 – HTTP proxy support and status check</h3>
    <p>Added support for HTTP proxies and UI improvements with proxy availability checks.</p>
    <h3>3.0.2 – Error handling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added notification for incorrect proxy settings</li>
        <li>Fallback if proxy times out</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3.0.1 – Housekeeping update</h3>

        <li>Hide password for custom proxy config</li>
        <li>Fixed checkbox setting for custom proxy</li>
        <li>Use DNS of proxy service</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3.0.0 – Crunchyroll Beta support</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Proxy requests for new token endpoint with SOCKS proxy</li>
        <li>Custom proxy configuration options</li>
        <li>Removed legacy login logic</li>
        <li>Modernized for Crunchyroll Classic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.3.1</h3>
    <p>Most issues seem to be errors getting new sessions. I think this is largely related to the reload loop. To
        improve on this I implemented a timer to only reload once a minute - if the session can not be obtained, it is
        unlikely to work a few seconds after.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Added timer between session reloads</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.3</h3>
    <p>Good news: unblocking while logged in is back!</p>
    <p>Some of you have hinted me a way but I could not replicate it for some reason. Thanks for telling me, and sorry
        for not getting this working sooner :)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed login handling</li>
        <li>Added disable button to popup to quickly disable the addon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.2.3</h3>
    <p>This is just a small update, sorry still no solution for logged in users :(</p>
    <p>But I removed the unblock servers that do not work anymore, this should make switching faster.</p>
    <p>Also, region switching won't happen while logged in. This way you can login/logout depending on the anime you
        want to watch. Still inconvenient, but better than nothing!</p>
    <h3>2.2.2b</h3>
    <p>Hi everyone! Maintainer from the Firefox extension here.</p>
    <p>Looks like the original creator (who is hosting the unblock server) of this project has no interest in keeping
        this up. This is why I'm taking over from here on.</p>
    <p>He said in his "farewell" message to just torrent anime. Please do not do that. Support the anime you love to
        watch, even more in these challenging times. I'll add some servers to the unblocker pool to "fix" the current
        problems of session IDs getting issued. Please keep in mind, my resources are limited. If anyone wants to help
        running unblock servers <a href="https://twitter.com/CrUnblocker">get in touch with me</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Greetings from Germany. Stay safe and healthy!</p>
